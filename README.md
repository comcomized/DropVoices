# DropVoices
*The use case:* 
* Having people on a grass root interactive platform interacting most simply - only with their voice and in their language, is a good thing for them and even for authorities, if and when are missing access to the people and to their actual wishes and needs.

The "DropVoices" app has array of "Who" objects
* keyed by users or channels, each having "Voices" being records 
 * keyed by time stamp, each having, audio file or link to such, and optionally string and image or link to such, where 
  * The channels also have 2 additional arrays: 
   *  publishers queuing "voices" and 
   *  listeners having users to be notified.

Each user, as operator can have one or more channels. 
* The channels are digestive for making its operators acting in a criticable responsible role, where each channel gets notification from users about "Voices" asked to be published in current queue or sometime else and, on the channel's acceptance, the channel notify its listeners about current "voices".
    
The financing of such platform should be in a [liquid union](http://liquid-unions.wikidot.com) having one radio project manged by the "DropVoices" app of which channels produce public events in the real world, events tagged as 
* Contractive of Inquiries and Ideas
* Activities of Get-Connected and Get-Organized
* Sharing also of Creative things, such as dramming :)
